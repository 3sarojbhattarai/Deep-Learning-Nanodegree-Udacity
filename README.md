This is the project I has done during Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge from Udacity. 

# Nanodegree Program Info

The Deep Learning Nanodegree program offers you a solid introduction to the world of artificial intelligence.
In this program, you’ll master fundamentals that will enable you to go further in the field, launch or advance
a career, and join the next generation of deep learning talent that will help define a beneficial, new,
AI-powered future for our world. You will study cutting-edge topics such as Neural Networks, Convolutional
Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Network Deployment,
and build projects in PyTorch and NumPy. You'll learn from authorities such Ian Goodfellow and Jun-Yan
Zhu, inventors of types of generative adversarial networks, as well as AI experts, Sebastian Thrun and
Andrew Trask. For anyone interested in this transformational technology, this program is an ideal
point-of-entry.

The program is comprised of 5 courses and 5 projects. Each project you build will be an opportunity to
prove your skills and demonstrate what you’ve learned in your lessons.
This is a term-based program that requires students to keep pace with their peers. The program is delivered
in 1 term spread over 4 months. On average, students will need to spend about 12-15 hours per week in
order to complete all required coursework, including lecture and project time.

**Length of Program** : 4 months  
**Frequency of Classes** : Term-based  
**Number of Reviewed Projects** : 5  
**Instructional Tools Available** : Video lectures, Personalized project reviews, Interactive Jupyter notebooks,
Text instructions, Quizzes, and Question-answering platforms: Knowledge, and Study Groups  


# Projects
Building a project is one of the best ways both to test the skills you've acquired and to demonstrate your
newfound abilities to future employers. Throughout this Nanodegree program, you'll have the opportunity
to prove your skills by building the following projects:
● Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns  
● Dog Breed Classifier  
● Generate TV Scripts  
● Generate Faces  
● Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model  

In the sections below, you'll find a detailed description of each project along with the course material that
presents the skills required to complete the project.
